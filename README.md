**MENTOR NAME**: Neela Santhosh Kumar 

**DESCRIPTION OF TASK**:
This project focuses on developing a recommendation system using Apache Mahout, an open-source machine-learning library. The system provides personalized recommendations based on collaborative filtering techniques. It is applicable in domains such as e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

Objectives:

Build a recommendation engine to predict user preferences.
Implement collaborative filtering using Mahout's core libraries.
Process and analyze user-item interaction data from a dataset.
Features:

Data Model Creation:
Utilize Mahout's FileDataModel to process interaction data in CSV format, containing user IDs, item IDs, and ratings.
Similarity Calculation:
Compute similarities between users using algorithms like Pearson Correlation or Tanimoto Coefficient.
Neighborhood Formation:
Identify nearest neighbors for a user based on similarity measures using Nearest N User Neighborhood.
Recommendation Generation:
Predict item preferences and generate recommendations for items the user hasn't interacted with yet.
Input:
A CSV file (data.csv) with data structured as:

Copy
Edit
user_id,item_id,rating  
1,101,5  
1,102,3  
2,101,4  
3,103,2  
Output:
A list of recommended items for a given user. Example:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Recommended Items:  
- Item ID: 104 (Predicted Rating: 4.7)  
- Item ID: 105 (Predicted Rating: 4.2)  
Technologies Used:

Java
Apache Mahout
Maven
Workflow:

Load user-item data from a CSV file.
Preprocess and model data using FileDataModel.
Calculate user or item similarities using built-in similarity measures.
Identify the nearest neighbors for a user.
Predict ratings for unrated items and generate recommendations.
Applications:

Product recommendations in e-commerce.
Movie or TV show recommendations on streaming platforms.
Personalized playlist generation in music platforms.
Future Enhancements:

Implement hybrid recommendation models combining collaborative and content-based filtering.
Support larger datasets and real-time recommendations.
Add additional algorithms for improved accuracy and scalability.
